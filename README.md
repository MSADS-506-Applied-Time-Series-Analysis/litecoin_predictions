# Litecoin Cryptocurrency Forecast â€“ Variations on the Autoregressive Moving Average Model: A Time Series Analysis

### Project Status: Completed

### Installation

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the commands below:

`git init`

`git clone https://github.com/MSADS-506-Applied-Time-Series-Analysis/litecoin_predictions.git`

### Project Intro/Objective

After being founded in 2011 by Charlie Lee as a peer-to-peer digital currency, Litecoin Foundation has experienced a fair share of peaks and troughs in the cryptocurrency space for reasons not affected by price alone. For example, many people still remain skeptical as to the real value behind the blockchain phenomenon that was largely exacerbated by the explosion of bitcoin (BTC). Litecoin came soon after, trading substantially low at roughly $3.00 per coin.  We endeavor to analyze the behaviors and patterns of litecoin for the past six years and use (i.e. seasonal) models to forecast a sound and proper price trajectory that will give prospective (especially conservative) investors a healthy outlook for future growth.
